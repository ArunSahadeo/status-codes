		"name": "Bad Request",
		"description": "The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)."
	},

	"401": {
		"name": "Unauthorized",
		"description": "Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication. 401 semantically means \"unauthenticated\", i.e. the user does not have the necessary credentials."
	},

		"name": "Payment Required",
		"description": "Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, as proposed for example by GNU Taler, but that has not yet happened, and this code is not usually used. Google Developers API uses this status if a particular developer has exceeded the daily limit on requests."

		"description": "Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the request, such as an edit conflict between multiple simultaneous updates."
	},

	"410": {
		"name": "Gone",
		"description": "Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices. Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a \"404 Not Found\" may be used instead."

	},

	"414": {
		"name": "URI Too Long",
		"description": "The URI provided was too long for the server to process. Often the result of too much data being encoded as a query-string of a GET request, in which case it should be converted to a POST request."
	},

	"415": {
		"name": "Unsupported Media Type",
		"description": "The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support. For example, the client uploads an image as image/svg+xml, but the server requires that images use a different format."
	},

	"416": {
		"name": "Range Not Satisfiable",
		"description": "The client has asked for a portion of the file (byte serving), but the server cannot supply that portion. For example, if the client asked for a part of the file that lies beyond the end of the file."

		"name": "I'm a teapot",
		"description": "This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fools' jokes, in RFC 2324, Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers. The RFC specifies this code should be returned by teapots requested to brew coffee. This HTTP status is used as an Easter egg in some websites, including Google.com."

	},

	"428": {
		"name": "Precondition Required",
		"description": "The origin server requires the request to be conditional. Intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict."
